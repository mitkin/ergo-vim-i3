# ergo-vim-i3
Keyboard layout optimized for ergodox, vim and i3 window manager

# About me
This is layout I made for myself after probably of hundreds of iterations over a couple of years. It is still work in progress. 

It is not for everybody. Ergodox keyboard is known to be quite large, and I have big hands with long fingers. I try to keep it compact, but if you have hands of average size I believe something like Corne keyboard would be a better choice.
